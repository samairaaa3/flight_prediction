# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Price Prediction using Random Forest

## üìå Overview

This project aims to predict flight ticket prices based on various features such as airline, source, destination, stops, duration, and more.  
It uses a **Random Forest Regressor**, fine-tuned using **RandomizedSearchCV**, and the final model is saved as a `.pkl` file for future use.

---

## üìä Dataset

The dataset contains historical flight details, including:
- Airline  
- Source & Destination  
- Total Stops  
- Duration  
- Route  
- Additional Info  
- **Price** (target variable)

> **Note:** Data cleaning and feature engineering were performed to convert text-based features into machine-readable format.

## üß† Machine Learning Approach

- **Model Used:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** RandomizedSearchCV  
- **Train-Test Split:** 80% training, 20% testing  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** R¬≤ Score, RMSE

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Train the Model (Optional)
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pickle

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train the model
rf_model = RandomForestRegressor()
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save the model
with open("models/rf_random.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(rf_model, f)
---
## load and predit
import pickle

# Load the model and make predictions
with open("models/rf_random.pkl", "rb") as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)



---
### LOAD AND PREDICT
import pickle

# Load the model
with open("models/rf_random.pkl", "rb") as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Predict on new data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
